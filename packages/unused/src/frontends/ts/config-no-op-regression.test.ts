/**
 * T4.3 acceptance: "no-config regression: zero-config output identical
 * pre/post this milestone" (phasing.md M4).
 *
 * `__testfixtures__/config-regression/golden-*.json` were captured by running
 * `analyzeProject` on these exact corpus fixtures BEFORE any T4.3/T4.4 code
 * (config loading, `project`/`entry` scoping, preset auto-detection)
 * existed — i.e. the actual pre-milestone output, not a re-derived
 * expectation. This test re-runs the POST-milestone `analyzeProject` (which
 * now always calls `loadConfig`/`filterFilesByConfig`/`activePresetsForUnit`
 * — the config layer is unconditionally "in the code path", per the spec)
 * over the same two fixtures, with no config file present in either, and
 * asserts the result is byte-for-byte identical (`run.durationMs` and
 * `run.root` excluded — durationMs is wall-clock and root is an absolute,
 * machine-dependent path; every other field, including `configHash`, must
 * match exactly).
 *
 * Two fixtures, per the spec's "≥2 corpus fixtures": `tsconfig-paths-alias`
 * (single package, alias resolution) and `workspace-pnpm-monorepo` (a real
 * monorepo — exercises the T4.2 workspace-unit path the config layer's
 * per-unit filtering/entry-seeding/preset-detection all thread through).
 * Neither fixture declares a `vite`/`next` dependency or ships a
 * `vite.config.*`/`next.config.*`/`index.html` — confirmed by inspection — so
 * T4.4 preset auto-activation is also exercised as a true no-op here, not
 * just T4.3's config loading.
 *
 * M6 update: `analyzeProject`'s out-of-band `AnalyzeResult` fields grew
 * `fileCount`/`workspaceCount`/`repoName` (the TTY report header,
 * `reporters/tty.ts`) — an additive, legitimate schema change unrelated to
 * config no-op-ness, so the two golden fixtures were updated to include
 * them (values taken from this same test's own output, not re-derived)
 * rather than loosening this test's byte-for-byte assertion.
